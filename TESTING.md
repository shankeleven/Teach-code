## Room State Synchronization Test

To test the fix for the room state synchronization issue:

### Test Steps:

1. **Start the frontend**: Run `npm run dev` in the frontend directory
2. **Open first browser window**:

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Create a new room (e.g., "test-room")
   - Enter username (e.g., "user1")
   - Join the room

3. **Add some content**:

   - Type some code in the editor (e.g., "console.log('Hello from user1');")
   - Switch to whiteboard and draw something
   - Switch back to editor and add more code

4. **Open second browser window**:

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Join the SAME room ("test-room")
   - Enter different username (e.g., "user2")

5. **Verify state synchronization**:

   - The second user should immediately see:
     - The code that user1 typed
     - The whiteboard drawings from user1
     - The correct language setting

6. **Test real-time sync**:
   - User2 types in editor → User1 should see changes
   - User2 draws on whiteboard → User1 should see drawings
   - User1 makes changes → User2 should see them

### Expected Behavior:

- ✅ New users get current room state immediately
- ✅ No more "empty state overwrites existing work" bug
- ✅ Real-time synchronization works for both editor and whiteboard
- ✅ No infinite update loops

### Backend Changes Made:

- Added `RoomState` struct to store room state
- Store code, language, and whiteboard elements per room
- Send current state to new users in WELCOME message
- Update room state when changes are broadcast

### Frontend Changes Made:

- Added initialization tracking to prevent immediate overwrites
- Whiteboard waits for WELCOME message before sending updates
- Code editor waits for initialization before sending changes
- Both components handle initial state from WELCOME message

### Debug Info:

Check browser console for:

- "WebSocket URL:" - should show correct URL
- "RECEIVED: action 'WELCOME'" - should show state object
- "SENDING: action 'CODE_CHANGE'" - should only appear after initialization
